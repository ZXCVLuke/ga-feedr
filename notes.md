#### What the hell Unix time is

A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is a large number which is either in seconds or milliseconds. Using JS it can be converted to UTC, ISO and more human-friendly formats using toDateString(), toISOString() and toUTCString() methods. It must be converted to a date first though using var d = new Date ();
